Question 2

Problem: Injury Prevention and Optimization of Player Health and Performance

Scope/Objectives of project:

Injury Risk Assessment:
Develop machine learning models that can assist in assessing the injury risk for individual players based on minutes played, physical fitness and fatigue data
Limitations/Strategy towards Game/Practice time:
Utilizing wearable technology to track phyiscal output of players during training or games. Given data, advice can be given on differing training regiments or suggesting more rest to players to optimize fitness
Performance Data -> Enhancing abilities:
Using game data, shot efficiency and tendencies on the court, analysis of the players data can be done and different programs and adjustments can be made to optimize improvement opportunities.
Rehabilitation Data Tracking -> Predicting Injury Recovery:
Develop models to predict recovery time for injured players and what fitness levels they return at the end based on training data.

Benefits:
Optimizing Player Potential and Performance:

With data to optimize recovery and training strategies, this can lead to improved player performance and team performance
Statistically Driven Strategies:
Since we are relying on data and statistics to make our decision making, things such as player health, player performance
and player sustainability can be made based on factual data rather than opinions or emotion
Player Longevity and Health:
In assessing the injuries and workload management of players, player peak performance is able to be sustained and
hence allowing careers to continue for a longer time than without this analysis

Challenges:

Gathering Data on Human Health:
Although the access to the technology is pretty easy, the ability to obtain, track and integrate data from multiple sources such as
medical records, heartbeat monitors, in game stats can be difficult to gather and assess
Developing models for Optimization:
As most of our models and research will be done from scratch, although it is very possible, the process of developing models for injury prevention
and performance optimization simply is just difficult
Costs and Time:
In this day and age, technology, research, and employees aren't at all cheap and it will definitely take some money to make something like this to work
The time it takes and amount of specific data needed to track information like this definitely isn't a small and will take numerous data collection sessions and
trials to generate the sample size needed to develop an accurate result

Conclusion:
In a league that involves hard cuts, quick lateral movements and physical output, its no wonder why injury has always been a problem. Its clear that with the accurate
analysis of player health, player longevity and player performance can see a lot of improvement and players can focus on their own game and the success of their team. Although the
collection of health data, collaboration amongst professionals (coaches, doctors, health scientists), and data analysts can be difficult, the results can greatly improve the longevity
of the players in the league
